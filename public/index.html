      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

              <h3>What the heck is this?</h3>
              An iOS developer I worked with had to generate random product names for an app we were working on.
              He was called Avario (<a href="https://github.com/avario">https://github.com/avario</a>) so when I ported it from Swift to Javascript, I decided
              to name it after him. I hooked it up to a recipe API so you can make Avario's amazing creations, like "Quite Boiled Chicken" or "Really Flaky Tuna Pie". Enjoy.
              You can read the (terrible, messy) source code <a href="https://github.com/andrewmccafferty/avario-matic">here</a>
